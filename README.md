## Doctor Lookup
#### By Dave Sarbora
#### To help you find the right doctor for your ailment!
## Description

This application will take in your city and ailment, and search a list of doctors who can help you with a particular problem.

## Specificiations
* A user will be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* A user will be able to to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* If the query response includes any doctors, the following information will be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data).
* If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application will return a notification that states what the error is.
If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application will return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it will be handled separately from any errors.)
